# About
I'm a third-year college student in Japan.　　
I major in agriculuture.  
I like taking care of kids.  
So, I had been working in a nursery school as a part-time job. But I've temporarily become unemployed because of COVID-19.  
My dream is teaching kids in developing countries how to grow up vegetables well.  
And making a living as a nomad worker.
